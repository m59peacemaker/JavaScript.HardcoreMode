JavaScript Hardcore Mode
===

**I broke this for a minute - it will be back and better in a bit....pesky .git folder**

Are you nanners about playing Diablo for hundreds of hours just to inevitably lose your level 92 barb forever? Now you can enjoy the same experience with your JavaScript projects! Just include the gulp task `js-hardcore-mode` from `gulpfile.js` and run it with `gulp js-hardcore-mode` before you begin coding. When jshint detects a problem with your code, **your whole project will be instantly erased!** Hardcore!

*\*You will probably be fired from your job.*

*\*You will probably feel awesome for completing an application.*

*\*If you are seeking a job and have no code samples, just tell employers that code samples and completed work are for Normal Mode scrubs. You're Hardcore like that.*
